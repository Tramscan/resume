  \sectionheading{Research Experience}
  \entry{University of Massachusetts Amherst HRSL, Amherst, MA}{Dec 2021 -- May 2022}
  \textit{Graduate Researcher}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Created control scripts in python to implement custom impedance control loops for a robotic hip exoskeleton using the FlexSEA API on Linux.
  \item Applied asymmetric stiffness to human gait to study behavioral adaptations to a resistant exoskeleton torque. Compiled and analyzed data from motion capture and ground reaction forces to identify key trends and possible neuromotor impacts.
  \item Used findings to evaluate the gait patterns resulting from the exoskeleton's impedance with results published in IROS 2022.
  \item Identified new control schemes for gait control, documenting and testing the initial implementation. Takeaways from the experiments were used to develop tools for realtime data analysis and an improved setup process.
