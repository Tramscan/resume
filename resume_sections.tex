% Research Experience Section - Research Version
\newcommand{\ResearchExperienceResearch}{
  \sectionheading{Research Experience}
  \entry{University of Massachusetts Amherst HRSL, Amherst, MA}{Dec 2021 -- May 2022}
  \textit{Graduate Researcher}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Created control scripts in python to implement custom impedance control loops for a robotic hip exoskeleton using a Raspberri Pi 4 and the FlexSEA API.
  \item Applied asymmetric perturbations to human gait to study behavioral adaptations to a resistant exoskeleton stiffness. Compiled and analyzed data from motion capture and ground reaction forces to identify key trends and possible neuromotor impacts.
  \item Used findings to evaluate the gait patterns resulting from the exoskeleton's impedance with results published in IROS 2022.
  \item Identified new control schemes for gait control, documenting and testing the initial implementation. Takeaways from the experiments were used to develop tools for realtime data analysis and an improved setup process.
  \end{itemize}

% Project Experience Section - Research Version
\newcommand{\ProjectExperienceResearch}{
  \sectionheading{Project Experience}
  \entry{Robotic Simulation}{October 2023 -- Present}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Built a Furuta pendulum model for use in Gazebo and Drake, controlled with C++ scripts and ROS 2. Developed swing-up and energy-minimizing controllers to stabilize pendulum. Future implementations include RL control of the pendulum and double pendulum control.
  \item Created a bipedal robot model in Gazebo and used Julia to output inverse dynamics from the system configuration. Future implementations include full-body control of the bipedal robot.
  \end{itemize}

  \entry{Robotic System Design}{January 2023 -- Present}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Designed and prototyped cycloidal and planetary gearboxes for use with brushless DC motors. Tested prototypes using speed control and iterated on design to improve assembly and strength.
  \item Produced a benchtop dynamometer prototype to compare performance and characteristics of two competing DC motors. 
  \end{itemize}

  \entry{Personal Website Tools}{June 2024 -- Present}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Developed modular LaTeX templates to streamline resume generation and standardize formatting across different versions, with live versions hosted on GitHub and viewable on my personal website.
  \item Created JavaScript widgets to display nonlinear dynamical systems, with interactive features to change initial conditions and parameters.
  %\item Developed a counter in Rust to record the number of times a user has clicked the widget.
